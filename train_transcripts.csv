What I enjoy most about writing is the freedom it gives to me to express my thoughts, ideas and creativity. It allows me to explore different worlds, create characters and share stories that can entertain, inspire and initiate the thoughts. The main tool I need for writing is a computer or a notebook and a pen. I also use various software programs to organize my ideas, edit my work and format my writing. I do enjoy practicing my hobby on my own or with others. Writing is often a salted activity and I value the quiet, focused time I spend alone with my thoughts. However, I also enjoy sharing my work with others. Writing is a hobby that allows me to be creative, express myself and connect with others who save my passion for storytelling."

I felt that I really enjoyed it because I was able to unpack the events of the day, how I was feeling. And what I realized that because I was unpacking my feelings, I felt less anxious about my life because I recorded what was happening in my life. So I use pen and paper.

When I think back to that day, I am filled with nostalgia for the memories created and the experience shared. It serves as a reminder of the importance of hard work, perseverance, goals and dreams."
audio_1219.wav,5.0,/kaggle/input/dataset/Dataset/audios/train/audio_1219.wav," Trying to grow in a crowded market is not easy. The days of building a website, sitting back and counting the profits are long gone. Now the new tech savvy kids on the block are using innovative strategies to connect with their target audiences. And if you continue using traditional techniques that don't differentiate you from your competition, you will quickly become yesterday's brand. To stand out and shine in a crowded marketplace that's selling similar products with similar features and solutions, you have to create compelling, authentic brand stories that show your customer you genuinely care and can solve their problems. Some brands already know this. That's why they are thriving, regardless of how crowded they are."

There's lots of tourists from all over the world that go through there. There's just a general background hum of activity. The goods that are sold in the market, they are sort of goods that are touristy. Things such as magnets with Hong Kong on them, other touristy paraphernalia like chopsticks, chong san, which is the traditional dress of the women in Hong Kong. Things with Chinese motifs like dragons and jade jewelry. It is rather noisy. You can hear the vendors haggling with the customers. It's busy from morning to night."

audio_23.wav,5.0,/kaggle/input/dataset/Dataset/audios/train/audio_23.wav," My favourite place to visit is a little place called Malham Cove which is in England. Malham Cove is a very beautiful place to visit because of the cliffs that were formed from the old limestones. It can be a little bit tricky to get there so on your way there's like a little small narrow lane and when you can park close to it you have to park a little bit further away by five minutes or so which makes it a little bit tricky to access. But once you're there it is absolutely stunning, it has breathtaking views, there's a little waterfall. There does be quite a few people there in terms of tourists but if you go around two or three o'clock when everyone else is returning home and you just go up you can have the place to yourself which is quite magical. Thank you."

audio_230.wav,5.0,/kaggle/input/dataset/Dataset/audios/train/audio_230.wav," I would say that my favorite hobby is probably reading, especially history, music, music history and world history, American history, ancient history. The main thing that I need for that, of course, is paperback books, hard copy books, my Kindle, which I can read on my phone, on my tablet, on my computer. And it's a personal thing. So I generally read on my own in the evening time before I go to bed, or maybe if I'm on a flight headed somewhere and waiting in the barber shop to get my haircut. So it becomes kind of a thing that you do when you have some time, just to kind of chill and relax mentally by yourself."

I think what makes this day so special is that I was surrounded by loved ones, so that was really meaningful. It was also a surprise planned by my friends, so they definitely put a lot of effort into that. And again, that meant a lot to me that they were willing to go through all of that for me. I think what also makes the day so special is that I mean, it's a lifetime commitment. And I think had that not happened, I would not be with my husband now since we have been together for so long. And when I think about that day, I feel warm and nostalgic."
audio_336.wav,5.0,/kaggle/input/dataset/Dataset/audios/train/audio_336.wav," I was about 12 years ago, I was taking my students to perform our annual performance assessment as they are musicians. And that day, before we left, I received a surprise that I was in the top three for teacher of the year for the entire school district. And then I took my students to their performance assessment that day. And it was the best performance that it was the best performance that they'd ever had. The judges were so impressed, they talk about it even to this day 12 years later. And it was just a special day because everything just seemed to go right that day. So when I think about that day, you know, from a career perspective, I kind of long for that kind of situation and how great things went that day."

Throughout my life I have had many memorable events. The memorable times in my life vary from being the worst time in my life and some being the best. Either way they have become milestones that will be remembered forever. The best day of my life was definitely the day that I received my driver's license. This day is one of the most memorable because of the feelings. I had when I received it and the opportunities that were opened up for me and the long lasting benefits that I received from it that still exist today. Getting my driver's license was an intense feeling that I ever forget. Just knowing that I had a license made me feel so free. As free as a bird flying in the open sky with no real place to go. Just a desire. It brought me great feelings and let me do more with my life.

I like the, I love the weather. The weather is always beautiful. Even in the summertime, the beach is never really that hot compared to central California or even, you know, deep down in southern or northern California. I love the atmosphere. It's very meaningful to me. I grew up in the beach when I was young. When I got a little older, I moved towards inward California. I love the restaurants. I love the piers. I love the ocean, the sand. Overall, you can't go wrong during a beach vacation."

And as the name implies, it's an island with basically a lighthouse and a couple of little houses. You need to get a ferry boat to get there. There's no other way to reach the island. I don't think they have any cultural or local foods or dishes, but they have this killer ice cream at one of the bars and it's really, really good. And yeah, I go there basically every summer to just experience it. You usually should leave in the morning so that you can get the most out of it."

And of course to do this you would have to use a various amount of tools. The mediums I love to work with are metal, wood, or just building computers, building bikes, building things out of wood. Basically just DIY, finding the little kinks and how things work and then building upon it. This hobby is done by myself because I don't want to be dragged down or rushed by other people. And it gives me a sense of satisfaction to know how things work and building up something from myself and then using it throughout my life."
audio_499.wav,5.0,/kaggle/input/dataset/Dataset/audios/train/audio_499.wav," My favorite place to visit has always been renting a cabin in southern Indiana or Kentucky. The reason that it's my favorite is because it's very secluded, it's surrounded by woods, there's a lot of nature around you. It's usually about a three to six hour drive depending on where the cabin is that I'm visiting. And we will always go out to dinner to different places. There's nothing specific that we go out there to eat, but we do enjoy the more southern food that's out there. And the best season to go is spring or early summer, so that way it's not too hot or not too cold. It's usually the perfect amount of warmth with a breeze outside. Thank you."
audio_551.wav,5.0,/kaggle/input/dataset/Dataset/audios/train/audio_551.wav," My favourite place to visit is Canada and in particular I like to go to Montreal. To be honest the journey to get there is not great. It's not too bad if you're going straight to Vancouver because that's a direct flight from where I live but otherwise it's probably about 18 hours to get to Montreal. Depends on the airplane, how comfortable that will be. I particularly like to go in winter because I love the snow and it's just so magical when the snow blankets the entire city and you can walk around, make snow angels, get really, really cold and then go inside and get really warm with hot chocolates and drinks. When I'm there I love to have poutine and beaver tails and probably some Timbits. Honestly all the food is amazing so there's nothing kind of specific but really my favourite thing is to have a good meal with friends and to catch up with everyone who I've missed so much. you"

And doing different activities such as going down the slide, using hopscotch ropes. There's monkey bars and swings. There's also people probably doing dares and bets. Maybe there's also a concession stand where they sell food. They give drinks out. And there's a bell as well to symbolize when it's over."

It's fun because I usually love going to Cairns in the summer when it smells really beautiful, it's quite humid, but it's also really warm and lovely and the people there are amazing. The local restaurants are also pretty beautiful. They serve, well, I live in Sydney, so the food is pretty similar. There's a lot of Italian up there, which is nice. And I love the plane ride. The plane ride is always so nostalgic and really fun. It's very short."

There is a broken swing set that just has some chains with missing seats. There is an old rusted slide and there's a metal merry-go-round that is creaking in the wind as the wind spins around in it. The activity that is popular among the students on the playground is sitting underneath the broken slide smoking cigarettes. The sounds you can hear in the school playground are the occasional sounds of laughter and some music coming from one of the students' phones. And just the wind blowing through the broken slide.

The faint sound bells signaling the part of the end classes and perhaps courtyard and playground of students gather the information and all the nations gather during ground where students gather during breaks. In typical school playground scenes, you might envision children running around, laughing and playing various games.

I first traveled there in 2010 and it was after a work conference in Las Vegas that was really hectic and it felt really magical because I got on a really small plane and the flight was really short and the airport, as soon as we landed the airport, was stunning, beautiful architecture, all open air, absolutely magical. My favorite restaurant there is Melvin's. It was a favorite hangout of the Rat Pack and especially Frank Sinatra. He had his wedding there and stayed, had his honeymoon and next door as well. I actually really liked being there in the middle of summer. That was absolutely stunning."
audio_250.wav,5.0,/kaggle/input/dataset/Dataset/audios/train/audio_250.wav," One of my favorite hobbies is to repurpose clothing. That's in the way of, I guess, making repairs. So things like holes in fabrics and lost buttons and zips which don't work anymore, it's just fixing that up. Other times it's just completely changing the design of that particular clothing into something else. Generally it doesn't require too much, I guess, tools to do this. A simple needle and thread is fine most of the time. For more complex things like turning a particular clothing into a different design, that does require a sewing machine. A lot of times I'm doing this by myself. Sometimes my sister and I will do it together, we'll do things like fix tights because we love exercise."
