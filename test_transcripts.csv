I was doing poorly in my study scoring average marks. However, my father taught me to never give up. So I kept studying trying to improve and finally I got what I aimed for. The moment my teacher announced that I scored the highest marks in my class everyone applauded. My friends were smiling with pride, my teacher was happy and my classmates were surprised. When I told my parents about my teachers they were bursting with joy and love. There a day after the happiest day of my life was full of hope and positive energy.

My favorite foods to have there is definitely ramen, of course sushi, but the main thing that I must always get like up there is the tuna onigiri, tuna mea onigiri from Family Mart. I can't explain it. It just tastes really good. Don't go to 7-eleven, it's not as good. As their particular time, the best time to go to Japan is it not the summer or September during the rainy season. The best time is to go in the spring for the cherry blossoms or alternative in the fall when the leaves start changing colors and the temperature is perfect."
